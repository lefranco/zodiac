It was early spring, warm and sultry
glowed the afternoon. The very breezes 
seemed to share the delicious langour of 
universal nature, ae laden the various 
and mingled perfumes of the rose and the 
zessaerne , the woodbine and its wildflower. 
They slowly wafted their fragrant offering 
to the open window where sat the lovers. 
The ardent sun shoot fell upon her blushing 
face and its gentle beauty was more like the 
creaton of tibenifb romance or the fairy
inspiration of a dream than the actual
reality on earth. Tenderly her lover gazed
upon her as the clusterous ringlets
were edged by amorous and sportive
zephyrs and when he perceived the rude
intrusion of the sunlight he sprang to
draw the curtain but softly she stayed
him. "No, no, dear Charles," she softly said, 
 "much rather you'ld I have a little sun than 
 no air at all."
